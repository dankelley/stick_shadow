        <p>The image below shows the shadow that would be made by a thin 2cm
        stick or pin oriented vertically to a flat level surface at Halifax, Nova
        Scotia, Canada.  The thick line emanating from the dot in the centre
        indicates that shadow.  For reference, a gray line extends to the angle
        axis, and a circle is drawn to indicate a shadow length of 2cm.</p>

        <p> This script is run at regular intervals throughout the day and night, but
        the full diagram is only shown whilst the sun is above the horizon at
        the study site.</p

        <p>The source code, <a href="stick_shadow.R">stick_shadow.R</a>, is
        written in the R language. Small alterations would be sufficient for
        application to other locations.</p>

        <p>A miniature observatory could be made by printing this on a
        regular-sized sheet of paper, attaching that to a piece of corrugated
        cardboard, and pushing a pin into the centre.  With this, it would be
        easy to determine the orientation of a room or a building. Adjusting
        the printed size so that the inner circle has radius 2cm will permit
        tests with shadow length.</p>
