        <p>The image shows the shadow that would be made by a thin 2cm stick
        aligned perpendicular to a flat level surface at Halifax, Nova Scotia,
        Canada at the indicated time.  The thick line emanating from the dot in
        the centre indicates the shadow of a stick placed at that dot.  The
        dotted circles have radii 1cm, 2cm, etc.</p>


        <p>The source code, <a href="stick_shadow.R">stick_shadow.R</a>, is
        written in the R language. It is run at regular intervals, to keep the
        webpage up-to-date.  With minor alterations, it could be used for other
        locations and times.</p>

        <p>Here's how to make a miniature solar observatory:</p>

        <ul>
            <li> Print this on a letter-size sheet of paper.</li>
            <li> Place the paper on a sheet of corrugated cardboard, foam, or a
                smooth carpet, that is in direct sunlight. The surface must be
                level.</li>
            <li> Hold a toothpick or sewing pin above the dot at the centre of
                the diagram, and carefully press it straight down through the
                paper and the material below. This should be as vertical as
            possible, to get a proper shadow on the paper.</li>
            <li> Carefully spin the paper around until the shadow made by the
                stick is aligned with the shadow drawn in the diagram.</li>
            <li> Look at the "N", "E", "S" and "W" markings along the outer
                circle.  These show the principle points of the compass.  (This
                is the true compass, not a magnetic compass.)</li>
        </ul>

        <p> <b>Safety Note.</b> Do not leave the toothpick or the pin in the
        sheet, especially if there are young children or animals in the
        household.</p>

        <p> If you want to make a diagram for another location or time,
        download <a href="stick_shadow.R">stick_shadow.R</a> and modify lines 2
        through 5 as appropriate, and then run this in Rstudio or another R
        program.  You'll need to install the 'oce' package (and perhaps some
        other packages) first.</p>

        <p> Let me know if you'd like me to write an R shiny application that
        would make it easy to explore how the shadow works at any place or
        time.</p>
