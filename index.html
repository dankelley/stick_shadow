        <p>The image shows the shadow that would be made by a thin 2cm stick
        aligned perpendicular to a flat level surface at Halifax, Nova Scotia,
        Canada at the indicated time.  The thick line emanating from the dot in
        the centre indicates the shadow of a stick placed at the dot.  For
        scale, the inner circle represents a 2cm radius.</p>

        <p> This script is run at regular intervals throughout the day and
        night, but the full diagram is only shown whilst the sun is above the
        horizon at Halifax.</p

        <p>The source code, <a href="stick_shadow.R">stick_shadow.R</a>, is
        written in the R language. Only minor alterations would be needed for
        application to other locations and times.</p>

        <p>Here's how to make a miniature solar observatory:</p>

        <ul>
            <li> Print this on a letter-size sheet of paper.</li>
            <li> Place the paper on a sheet of corrugated cardboard, or foam,
                or a carpet.</li>
            <li> Shove a toothpick or sewing pin straight down through the paper
                and into the material below, at the centre dot on the diagram.</li>
            <li> Rotate the paper around until the shadow made by the sun lines
                up with the line in the diagram.</li>
            <li> The angle axis indicates the directions of the compass.  (This is the true
                compass, not a magnetic compass.)</li>
        </ul>

        <p> For safety, do not leave the toothpick or the pin in the sheet,
        especially if there are young children or animals in the household.</p>

        <p> If you want to make a diagram for another location or time,
        download <a href="stick_shadow.R">stick_shadow.R</a> and modify lines 2
        through 5 as appropriate, and then run this in Rstudio or another R
        program.  You'll need to install the 'oce' package (and perhaps some
        other packages) first.</p>
