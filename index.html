        <p>The image below shows the shadow that would be made by a thin 0.2m
        stick oriented vertically to a flat level surface at Halifax, Nova
        Scotia, Canada.  The thick line emanating from the dot in the centre
        indicates that shadow.  (For reference, the inner circle is drawn to
        represent a shadow length of 0.2m.)</p>

        <p> This script is run at regular intervals.  The source code, <a
            href="stick_shadow.R">stick_shadow.R</a>, is written in the R
        language. Small alterations would be sufficient for application to
        other locations.</p>

        <p>A miniature observatory could be made by printing this on a
        regular-sized sheet of paper, attaching that to a piece of corrugated
        cardboard, and pushing a pin into the centre.  With this, it would be
        easy to determine the orientation of a room or a building. Obviously,
        this tool would indicate true north, not magnetic north.</p>
